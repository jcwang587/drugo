Drugo is a database primarily composed of drug molecules, designed to serve as a benchmark dataset for predicting sites of metabolism. The current goal of this project is to provide a database containing molecular structural information using SMILES strings and structurally assigned literature references. Currently, the priority for the construction of the database is focusing on the CYP450 3A4 substrate database.
